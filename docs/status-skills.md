## At a glance

| Skill | Version | Invocation | Argument hint | Output lands in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plab-ai-review` | 1.2.1 | Auto + explicit | `<doc.md> [--reviewer codex\|gpt\|gemini] [--respond]` | Beside the source doc, plus `_archive/` on `--close` |
| `plab-continue-session` | 1.4.0 | Auto + explicit | `[--log <path>]` | Nothing. Displays context only |
| `plab-guide` | 2.2.2 | Auto + explicit | `<topic-or-repo-url> [--type repo-url\|tool\|concept] [--out <dir>] [--force]` | `_output/plab-guide/` |
| `plab-init-project` | 1.3.0 | **Explicit only** | `[--profile minimal\|standard\|public] [--type ...] [--agents ...] [--dry-run]` | The target repository root |
| `plab-release-plan` | 1.5.0 | Auto + explicit | `--create \| --promote \| --demote \| --update \| --gate` | `docs/internal/release-plans/plan_NN_<slug>/` |
| `plab-spec` | 1.3.2 | Auto + explicit | `--effort <id> [--target-release vX.Y.Z] [--revise] [--dry-run]` | `docs/internal/release-plans/_unassigned/` by default |
| `plab-strategy-brief` | 1.1.1 | Auto + explicit | `[paste raw thinking]` | `_output/plab-strategy-brief/` |
| `plab-wrap-session` | 1.6.2 | Auto + explicit | `[mode: quick\|final\|deep\|blocked] [--organize]` | `_local/_session-logs/` (gitignored) |

**Explicit only** means the skill carries `disable-model-invocation: true`. It never fires on its own and is absent from the auto-loaded skill listing. It runs when you type its name and only then. **Only `plab-init-project` carries it now.** `plab-spec` and `plab-release-plan` carried it through 1.2.1 and 1.3.0 respectively; both are now auto-discoverable, using explicit do-NOT-fire clauses in their descriptions instead of the binary flag.

## Per-skill detail

### `plab-wrap-session` 1.6.2

The most-used skill in the plugin. Writes a structured session log and hands off to `plab-continue-session`.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Default mode | **deep**. Every wrap produces the full template unless the agent records a specific objection in the log justifying a lighter mode |
| Modes | `deep` (default), `quick`, `final`, `blocked`, plus `--organize` |
| Output | `_local/_session-logs/`, flat, archived into `YYYY-MM/` folders by `--organize` |
| Scripts | `dash-check.py`, `organize-logs.py`, `path-citation-check.py`, `test-organize-logs.py` |
| Setup required | Python 3 on PATH. `ripgrep` for the dash gate, which reports `broken` rather than `clean` if absent |
| References | 4 files |
| Paired with | `plab-continue-session`. A session-log format change in one requires a matching change in the other |

Runs a pre-wrap hygiene sweep across five checks (remote divergence, working tree, release state, documentation drift, session-log store) under per-action confirmation, and a Log Self-Check gate before writing. Two of those gates are canary-proven and report three states: `clean`, `findings`, `broken`, where `broken` blocks exactly as `findings` does.

### `plab-continue-session` 1.4.0

Reads the newest session log and replays its recorded handoff.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Default behavior | Find newest log, display resumption context, confirm before acting |
| Output | **None.** The output is the displayed context and the act of starting the named next action |
| Scripts | None |
| Setup required | Nothing beyond a readable session-log store |
| References | 3 files |
| Discovery paths | `_local/_session-logs/` (current, including `YYYY-MM/` folders), `_agent-context/session-log/` (legacy), `AGENTS/session-log/` (legacy) |

Deliberately does **not** fire on status questions ("where are we", "what's next"). Those get answered directly. Never auto-executes a continuation prompt without confirmation.

### `plab-ai-review` 1.2.1

Structured peer review of a document by a second model.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Default mode | `--review`, which generates a self-contained review request |
| Modes | `--review` (default), `--respond`, `--close` |
| Output | A review request beside the source doc; `--close` archives the pair into `_archive/` and writes unresolved items to a backlog |
| Scripts | None |
| Setup required | **A second model reachable by you.** The handoff is manual: you paste the request into a reviewer and bring findings back |
| References | 5 files, 1 example |
| Reviewers named | `codex`, `gpt`, `gemini` |

Known gap: `argument-hint` advertises only `--respond`, so a reader of the hint alone would not learn `--close` exists. The description documents all three.

### `plab-guide` 2.2.2

Generates a paired guide bundle from a topic, tool name, or GitHub URL.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Default behavior | Produces the full four-artifact bundle |
| Output | `_output/plab-guide/`, overridable with `--out` |
| Artifacts | Standard Markdown, ADHD Markdown, quick-reference HTML, and a 1-2 page PDF |
| Scripts | 8, including `check-toolchain.sh`, `render-pdf.sh`, `validate-manifest.py`, `regression-test.sh` |
| Setup required | **A Chromium-based browser** (Chrome, Chromium, or Edge) for PDF rendering. `check-toolchain.sh` detects it during intake and warns without blocking |
| References | 9 files, 1 asset |
| Shared deps | `lib/render-mermaid.py` and `references/diagrams.md` at plugin root |

PDF rendering spends **zero LLM tokens**; the script invokes a local browser binary. The renderer steps `--fit-scale` down from 1.00 to 0.85 until content fits, failing only if it still overflows at minimum scale.

### `plab-strategy-brief` 1.1.1

Turns raw, unstructured thinking into a decision-ready analysis document.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Default behavior | Full structured brief: problem space, analysis, approaches, an 80/20 recommendation, evidence map, open items |
| Output | `_output/plab-strategy-brief/` |
| Scripts | None |
| Setup required | Nothing |
| References | 4 files |

Explicitly not for summarizing already-structured documents, editing polished prose, or pure research queries with no raw thinking supplied.

### `plab-spec` 1.3.2

Writes a feature specification optimized for agent execution.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Invocation | **Auto-discoverable as of 1.3.0.** Fires on an explicit request to write a spec. Do-NOT-fire clause covers passing mentions of "spec", questions about an existing spec, and requests to implement one |
| Default output | `docs/internal/release-plans/_unassigned/<effort>/spec.md` |
| With `--target-release` | Writes straight into `plan_NN_<slug>/` |
| Scripts | None |
| Setup required | Nothing. Creates its folders |
| References | 6 files |

Produces frontmatter, an agent-updated Task Summary block, and numbered acceptance criteria with source citations. Defines **what** to build. `/superpowers:writing-plans` defines how; `/plab-strategy-brief` explores why.

### `plab-release-plan` 1.5.0

Manages a version-scoped release plan folder.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Invocation | **Auto-discoverable as of 1.4.0.** Fires on release scoping, promotion, and readiness checks. Do-NOT-fire clause covers general planning talk, changelog requests, and questions about what shipped |
| Subcommands | `--create`, `--promote`, `--demote`, `--update`, `--gate` |
| Output | `docs/internal/release-plans/plan_NN_<slug>/plan.md`. **Folders are named by sequence and theme, not version**; the version lives in `target-version:` frontmatter |
| Scripts | None |
| Setup required | A `release-checklist.yaml` is optional; project rows merge with built-in defaults, and the built-in wins on collision |
| References | 6 files |

Auto-generates the aggregation table from folder contents and enforces hygiene gates plus a doc-update checklist that gates the tag. **Refuses to invent or modify acceptance criteria**; those live in specs, and the release plan only aggregates.

### `plab-init-project` 1.3.0, explicit only

Scaffolds agentic development infrastructure into a repository.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Invocation | `disable-model-invocation: true` |
| Profiles | `minimal` (experiments), `standard` (working projects), `public` (open source) |
| Types | `general`, `code-python`, `code-node` |
| Output | The target repository root |
| Scaffolds | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, gitignored `_local/_session-logs/`, MADR v4 decision records |
| Scripts | None |
| Setup required | Nothing. Non-destructive and idempotent, safe against an existing repo |
| Dry run | `--dry-run` |
| References | 4 files |

Pairs with `plab-wrap-session` and `plab-continue-session`, which write and read the session logs it scaffolds.

## Shared plugin-root dependencies

Used by skills rather than duplicated inside them:

| Path | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/render-mermaid.py` | `plab-guide` | Mermaid diagram rendering |
| `references/diagrams.md` | `plab-guide` | Diagram conventions |
| `references/decisions-section.md` | `plab-spec`, `plab-strategy-brief` | Shared decisions-section format. Resolves at plugin root, not skill root |
| `scripts/check-dashes.py` | CI | Canary-proven dash detector, invoked by `.github/workflows/gate.yml` |

---

## Conventions in force

| Convention | Value |
|---|---|
| Prefix | `plab-` (org-level, prisant-labs) |
| Output root | `_output/<skill-name>/` |
| Session logs | `_local/_session-logs/`, gitignored, never committed |
| Conformance tier | Universal, standard 0.14 |
| Agent targets | `claude`, `codex` |
| License | MIT, on the plugin and every skill |
| Dash rule | No em-dashes or en-dashes anywhere. Enforced in CI and by a local PreToolUse hook |

Every skill carries a `HISTORY.md` and a usage README at `docs/skills/<name>/README.md`. All eight usage READMEs currently state the same version as their skill.

## Regenerating this file

Every value above is derived from `library.json`, `manifest.generated.json`, and the frontmatter of each `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Nothing here is authored judgment, so nothing here should be hand-maintained: when a skill version, argument hint, or dormancy flag changes, this file is stale until regenerated from those sources.
