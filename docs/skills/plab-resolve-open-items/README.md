# plab-resolve-open-items

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Source:** [`skills/plab-resolve-open-items/`](../../../skills/plab-resolve-open-items/)

Walk through the questions, decisions and tasks a session has left open, answer them all in one line, and have each answer written back beside its question. Every walk also leaves a local walk record, so the conversation that produced the answers can be found again.

---

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

When a session has built up things only you can settle, ask for a walk in your own words:

```
Walk me through the pending questions, decisions, and needed clarifications.
```

The skill gathers what is open, presents it as numbered D, Q and T items, and waits for one line such as `D1 A, D2 B, Q1: the NAS, T1 later`.

### Common Invocations

```
# Walk everything this session has left open
/plab-resolve-open-items

# Walk the open items of one document only
/plab-resolve-open-items docs/internal/release-plans/_unassigned/WD-01_resolve-open-items/spec.md

# The same, in plain words; the skill fires on either
resolve the open items in the WD-01 spec
```

### Installation

Install via the prisant-labs marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add prisant-labs/agent-plugins
/plugin install prisant-utilities@prisant-labs
```

## When to Use

- A session has raised several questions or decisions, and you want to settle them together.
- You say "walk me through the pending questions and decisions", "resolve open items", "what do you need me to decide", or "decision sitting".
- You want one document's open items settled, such as a spec's "Open Questions / Decisions" section.

## When NOT to Use

- **A code walkthrough.** "Walk me through `bundle-check.py`" gets an explanation of the code, not a walk.
- **A single decision question.** "Should the record go in A or B?" gets a direct recommendation.
- **A status question.** "Where are we?" or "what's next?" gets an answer from context. If items are open, the answer says so and offers a walk.

---

## How It Works

1. **Gather.** Items come from two places only: what this conversation left unresolved, and the "Open Questions / Decisions" sections of documents this session has read or written. Pointed at one document, the walk covers that document alone.
2. **Present.** Each item is a **D** (a decision between lettered options, with a recommendation and a confidence level), a **Q** (a question only you can answer, with the default the walk assumes if you skip it), or a **T** (a task only you can do). An item found in several documents is shown once, under its one home.
3. **Read your answer.** One line answers everything. Each item ends up with one state.
4. **Write back.** Each answered item's home document is updated on its three surfaces: the summary-table row, the subsection's status, and the maintainer decision block, which gains a `Follow-up` line. Every other copy gets a pointer to the home. A self-check confirms nothing else changed.
5. **Ask again where needed.** Anything you asked about, did not understand, or answered with an alternative comes back in a further round, with more context.
6. **Record.** A walk record lists every item, your answer, and where it landed.
7. **Offer.** For an architectural decision, the skill offers an architecture decision record. On request, it prints a `gh issue create` command for you to run.

## An example walk

The skill presents:

```markdown
### D1: Sync authority (from docs/specs/sync.md, D1)

When both copies changed, which one wins? Conflicts are rare, but each one stops the sync today.

- **Option A:** The laptop wins, and the archive's version is kept beside it.
- **Option B:** The archive wins, and the laptop's version is kept beside it.

**Recommendation:** A. The laptop is where edits happen. Confidence: high.

### Q1: Archive drive name (no source document)

What is the archive drive called on the network?

**Default if skipped:** `archive`, the name in the setup notes.

### T1: Rotate the sync token (no source document)

The token expires on Friday. Answer `done`, `later` or `drop`.

Answer in one line, such as `D1 A, Q1: archive2, T1 later`, or `ok` to accept every recommendation and default.
```

You answer `D1 A, but I'm not sure. T1 later`. The result:

- **D1** is `Provisional`. The spec's D1 shows that status on all three surfaces, with your words "but I'm not sure" quoted in its reasoning and a `Follow-up` line naming the work.
- **Q1** is assumed to be `archive`, because you skipped it. The walk record marks it assumed, not decided, and no document is changed.
- **T1** is `later`, recorded in the walk record only.

## How answers are read

| You write | It means |
|---|---|
| `D1 A` | D1 is decided as option A |
| `D1 A, but I'm not sure` or `D1 A i guess` | D1 is provisional as option A, with your words kept |
| `D1 A. Why not B?` | D1 is decided as A, and your question is answered in the same reply |
| `D1: expand this` or `D1: I don't understand this` | D1 comes back next round, with more context |
| `Q1: the NAS` | Q1's answer is "the NAS", verbatim |
| `T1 done`, `T1 later`, `T1 drop` | The task's state |
| An item left out | A decision stays as it was; a question takes its stated default, marked assumed; a task stays open |
| `ok`, `accept all`, `accept the rest` | Every item not otherwise answered takes its recommendation or default |

Silence is never read as agreement. Only an explicit "ok" or "accept the rest" applies the recommendations.

## Where things land

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| An answer to an item from a document | That item's home document, on its three surfaces |
| Other copies of that item | A pointer to the home, with the home's status |
| Skipped decisions, assumed questions, tasks, and items from the conversation | The walk record only |
| The walk record | `_local/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD_walk_<slug>.md`, or a decisions folder your repository already names |
| An answer whose document is on another branch | Nowhere: the intended edit is printed for you instead |

The walk record stays local because it is the conversation. Its outcomes reach tracked files through write-back.

## Statuses

Write-back uses the seven statuses of `references/decisions-section.md` at the plugin root. **Open** and **Needs info** come before an answer. **Decided**, **Provisional**, **Deferred**, **Canceled** and **Superseded** are what an answer can be.

## The self-check

`scripts/walk-check.py` runs after every write-back and after the walk record is written:

```bash
python skills/plab-resolve-open-items/scripts/walk-check.py writeback <copy before> <document after>
python skills/plab-resolve-open-items/scripts/walk-check.py record <walk record>
```

Exit 0 is clean, 1 names each broken rule, and 2 means the check could not run, which is never read as clean. CI runs both modes against the committed sample in `skills/plab-resolve-open-items/examples/sample-walk/`.

## Not in this version

These are deferred or separate work:

- **The `--backlog` mode.** A sweep across every spec, plan, session log and decision register in the repository at once, sorted into a standalone backlog file.
- **No automatic GitHub filing.** The walk prints a `gh issue create` command and never files the issue itself.
- **No GitHub Projects board.** Items are not placed on, or moved across, a board.
- **No gathering across repositories.** A walk covers the current repository only.
- **No published web page.** A walk happens in the conversation, not on a rendered page.

## Reference Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/walk-format.md` | Sources, the D, Q and T series, the one-home rule, and the presentation format |
| `references/answer-line.md` | The answer grammar, the states, skips, explicit acceptance, and worked examples |
| `references/write-back.md` | The three surfaces, provisional answers, `Follow-up`, pointers, the branch guard, the self-check, and what needs confirmation |
| `references/walk-record.md` | The walk record's location, table, rounds, and an example |

## Hard Constraints

- Never writes to a document on another branch.
- Never rewrites an item's own analysis; only its status, its table row and its decision block change.
- Never reads silence as acceptance.
- Never runs `gh issue create`, and never writes an architecture decision record without your yes.
- Asks first only before deleting, pushing, merging, posting outside the repository, or editing outside the repository.
