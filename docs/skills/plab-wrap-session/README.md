# plab-wrap-session

**Version:** 1.4.1
**Source:** [`skills/plab-wrap-session/`](../../../skills/plab-wrap-session/)

Document and close agentic coding sessions with structured session logs. Deep mode is the default: a full log with evidence index, a verbose copy-paste-ready continuation prompt, a pre-wrap hygiene sweep (remote divergence, release state, doc drift, working-tree reconciliation with per-action confirmation), and a mandatory Waiting on You section listing everything blocked on the maintainer, with links.

---

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

At the end of any coding session:

```
/plab-wrap-session
```

The skill gathers evidence (git status, decisions, files changed), selects a mode, and writes a structured session log to `_local/_session-logs/` with a continuation prompt you can paste into the next session.

### Where Logs Go

```
_local/_session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<llm>_<brief-kebab-title>.md
```

All agents write to the same centralized directory. The LLM short name in the filename identifies who did the work. The skill creates the directory if it doesn't exist.

Once a month closes, `--organize` files its logs into a `YYYY-MM/` subfolder. New logs are always written flat at the top level, so the path above never changes.

### Installation

Install via the prisant-labs marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add prisant-labs/agent-plugins
/plugin install prisant-utilities@agent-plugins
```

---

## When to Use

- End of any coding session (the most common trigger)
- Switching tasks or contexts mid-work
- When you're blocked and need to capture the blocker for the next session
- When you say "wrap up", "end of session", "session log", or "close out"

## When NOT to Use

- Mid-session status checks (just ask "what have we done so far?")
- Documenting design decisions (use ADRs or decision logs)
- Writing project documentation (use docs/ directly)

---

## Four Modes

**Deep is the default.** Every wrap is deep unless the agent records a specific objection in the log justifying a lighter mode (the same comply-or-explain contract that governs continuation-prompt verbosity). You can always override in either direction.

### Quick

**When:** Downgrade with stated objection: short session (< 30 min), few files, trivial fix.

**Output:** Frontmatter + summary + files changed + Waiting on You + continuation prompt (verbose by default; agent may emit a lighter prompt only with a stated objection). No detailed body sections.

### Final

**When:** Downgrade with stated objection: mid-length, low-risk session with nothing autonomous.

**Output:** Full structured log with all sections:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Summary** | 2-4 sentences - what happened and why it matters |
| **Work Completed** | Bulleted accomplishments |
| **Decisions Made** | Each decision with rationale (scaled to significance) |
| **Files Changed** | From git, grouped by purpose |
| **Verification** | What was tested, assumed, or skipped |
| **Outstanding Issues** | Blockers, risks, unfinished work |
| **Hygiene Sweep** | Pre-wrap sweep findings: state found, actions proposed, taken vs declined |
| **Waiting on You** | Everything blocked on the maintainer, with reasons and file links; "Nothing pending." when empty |
| **What's Next** | Ordered list, most important first; names the single unlocking decision when one exists |
| **Continuation Prompt** | Copy-paste-ready for next session; carries the Waiting on You list |

### Deep (Default)

**When:** Every session, unless a downgrade objection is recorded.

**Output:** Full log + evidence index + detailed verification table. Everything in Final mode, plus forensic-level detail.

Before writing, deep and final modes run the **pre-wrap hygiene sweep** ([`references/hygiene-sweep.md`](../../../skills/plab-wrap-session/references/hygiene-sweep.md)): git fetch and remote comparison (catches parallel work from another checkout), working-tree and worktree state, release hygiene (pending CHANGELOG content, version-vs-tag consistency, the repo's own CI scripts), and documentation drift. Each finding becomes one concrete proposal executed only on your per-action confirmation; declined proposals are recorded and carried into the continuation prompt.

### Blocked

**When:** Session ended by an unresolved blocker.

**Output:** Frontmatter + summary + blocker details + continuation prompt. Focuses on capturing the blocker clearly so the next session can resolve it.

## Organizing the log store (`--organize`)

A flat session-log directory grows without bound. At roughly four logs a week it passes a hundred files inside a year, and browsing it by hand stops being pleasant.

```
/plab-wrap-session --organize
```

This runs **instead of** a wrap. No session log is written, no hygiene sweep runs. It files logs from closed months into `YYYY-MM/` subfolders:

```
_local/_session-logs/
  2026-05/
    2026-05-19_14-30_claude_skill-audit.md
  2026-06/
    2026-06-02_11-15_codex_guide-pdf-toolchain.md
    2026-06-30_09-40_claude_capture-lite-hook.md
  2026-07-21_16-05_claude_release-v011.md          <- hot, previous month
  2026-08-18_13-44_claude_marketplace-ssh-to-https-fix.md   <- hot, current month
  _capture/                                        <- never touched
```

**The current month and the previous month are never filed.** Recent logs stay flat, which is where resume reads them first. On 2026-08-18 that means 2026-08 and 2026-07 stay put, and 2026-06 and older get filed.

**Nothing moves without your say-so.** The skill runs the organizer in dry run, shows you exactly which files would move where, and asks once. Declining changes nothing.

**Resume is unaffected.** `/plab-continue-session` 1.3.0+ reads the flat store and the month folders as one pooled set, sorted by filename, so an archived log and a hot log order correctly against each other. Filenames never change when a log is filed.

**You do not have to remember this exists.** Deep and final wraps run hygiene Check 5, which reports unfiled logs and offers to file them:

> Log store: 14 logs from 3 closed months (2026-05, 2026-06, 2026-07) are unfiled.
> File them into month folders? (y/n)

### Guarantees

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Current or previous month | Never filed |
| Target filename already exists | Skipped and reported, nothing overwritten |
| File that is not a session log | Left in place and reported |
| Subdirectory other than `YYYY-MM` | Never entered |
| Legacy log directories | Never touched |
| Anything | Never deleted; moves only |

Run it twice and the second run does nothing. A full worked example with real command output: [`skills/plab-wrap-session/examples/organize-logs-walkthrough.md`](../../../skills/plab-wrap-session/examples/organize-logs-walkthrough.md).

## Output Shape

The skill writes one session log to `_local/_session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<llm>_<brief-kebab-title>.md`. Section depth scales to the selected mode (quick / final / deep / blocked); the table below shows the full Final-mode shape:

| Section / Element | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| YAML frontmatter | Machine-readable metadata across 3 tiers (date, machine, repo, branch, summary, files-changed always; session-type, model, status, decisions-count, skills-used, resumed-from when available) for indexing and tooling |
| `## Summary` | 2-4 sentences: what happened and why it matters |
| `## Work Completed` | Bulleted, specific list of accomplishments |
| `## Decisions Made` | Each decision with rationale, scaled from one-liner to full alternatives analysis |
| `## Files Changed` | From git, grouped by purpose |
| `## Gitignored Outputs` | Work products git cannot see (`_local/` and kin): path + one-liner each |
| `## Verification` | Checklist of what was tested, assumed, or skipped (never conflates completed with verified) |
| `## Outstanding Issues` | Blockers, risks, unfinished work |
| `## Hygiene Sweep` | Sweep findings and the fate of each proposal |
| `## Waiting on You` | Items blocked on the maintainer, with links; required in every mode |
| `## What's Next` | Ordered list, most important action first |
| `## Continuation Prompt` | Copy-paste-ready fenced block: task context, current state, immediate next action, file paths, branch, and the Waiting on You list. Verbose by default in every mode |

Quick mode trims to summary + files + waiting-on + continuation prompt; blocked mode swaps in a `## Blocker` (what / who can unblock / impact); deep mode adds an `## Evidence Index` and a `## Verification Detail` table. Per-mode skeletons live in [`references/session-log-template.md`](../../../skills/plab-wrap-session/references/session-log-template.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Wrap After a Bug Fix

```
/plab-wrap-session
```

**Output:** (~30 lines)

Filename: `_local/_session-logs/2026-04-08_16-45_claude_fix-null-pointer.md`

```yaml
---
date: 2026-04-08T16:45:00-07:00
repo: my-project
branch: fix/null-check
summary: "Fix null pointer in user lookup when email is missing"
files-changed:
  - src/users/lookup.ts
session-type: bugfix
model: claude opus 4.6
model-settings: extended-thinking max
status: completed
---
```

Summary, one file changed, continuation prompt: "The fix is committed but not pushed. Push and verify in staging."

### Example 2: Final Wrap After Feature Work

```
/plab-wrap-session
```

**Output:** (~80 lines) Full log with 6 files changed across 3 commits, 2 decisions documented, verification checklist (tests passing, linting clean, manual QA not done), and a specific continuation prompt naming the next file to implement.

### Example 3: Blocked Wrap

```
/plab-wrap-session
```

**Output:** (~40 lines) Captures the blocker ("CI fails on node 18 - the sharp dependency requires node 20, but the CI image is pinned to 18"), what was tried, and a continuation prompt focused on resolving the blocker.

---

## The Continuation Prompt

This is the single most important output. Requirements:

- **Copy-paste ready** - wrapped in a fenced code block
- **Specific** - names exact files, branches, and next actions
- **Bounded** - one clear immediate action, then ordered secondary steps
- **Self-contained** - readable without the original session

A continuation prompt that says "continue where we left off" has **failed**. It must include enough context for a cold-start session.

### Verbose by default (v1.1.0)

The continuation prompt defaults to the verbose / deep form **in every mode**, including quick. The only path to a lighter prompt is for the agent to state a specific objection in the session log (e.g., "trivial typo fix; no context to carry forward"). This is a comply-or-explain rule: produce the verbose form, or produce a lighter form with the explicit reason recorded.

### Good Example

```
Continue work on acme-service (~/code/acme-service).

Last session deployed the ai-review skill v1.0.0 and pushed to origin.

Current state:
- 4 deployed skills (plab-guide, plab-strategy-brief, plab-wrap-session, plab-ai-review)
- Retry-policy plan doc written with 9 open decisions

Immediate next action:
1. Resolve the retry-policy decisions (D1-D9 in plan_v1_retry-policy.md)
2. Build the retry middleware from the resolved plan
```

### Bad Example

```
Continue where we left off on the project.
```

## YAML Frontmatter

Every log includes metadata for indexing and future tooling:

| Tier | Fields | When |
|------|--------|------|
| **1 (always)** | date, repo, branch, summary, files-changed | Every log |
| **2 (when available)** | session-type, parent-session, model, model-settings, agent, status, decisions-count | Most logs |
| **3 (when applicable)** | duration-minutes, tokens-used, commit-sha, tags, related-issues | Complex sessions |

See `references/frontmatter-schema.md` for the complete 18-field specification.

### Session Types

`bugfix` | `feature` | `refactor` | `research` | `planning` | `review` | `docs` | `autonomous` | `exploration`

---

## Surrounding Document Updates

After writing the log, the skill checks if changes warrant updates to README, CHANGELOG, or active plans. Rules:

- **README:** Only when user-facing capabilities changed
- **CHANGELOG:** Only when release-worthy (new feature, visible bugfix, breaking change)
- **Plans:** Only when sequence, scope, or assumptions changed

**Always asks for confirmation** before editing any surrounding document.

## Constraints

- Never embeds full transcripts (references the transcript path only)
- Never conflates "completed" with "verified"
- Never auto-commits or pushes
- Never updates surrounding docs without confirmation
- Summary must be 120 characters or less
- Session log must be self-contained

---

## Tips

- **The continuation prompt is worth the entire skill.** If wrap-session did nothing else, a good continuation prompt would justify its existence.
- **Quick mode is fine for most sessions.** Don't over-document trivial work. A typo fix needs a quick wrap, not a deep forensic record.
- **Verification honesty matters.** "Tests not run" is more useful than silence. Future-you needs to know what was assumed.
- **Let git be the source of truth for files.** The skill runs git commands to ground file changes in reality rather than relying on session memory.
- **Use blocked mode proactively.** When you hit a wall, wrap immediately while the blocker is fresh. Don't try to push through and then forget the details.

## Improvement Ideas

- Automatic session duration tracking (start/end timestamps)
- Session log search/index tool across all session logs
- Session chains - link parent/child sessions for multi-session work
- Template customization per project (some projects need different sections)
- Integration with GitHub Issues (auto-link session work to open issues)
- Aggregation view - weekly/monthly summary across all session logs
