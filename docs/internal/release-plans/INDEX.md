# Release Plan Index

Generated file. Regenerate with `python scripts/gen-release-index.py` from the repository root. Hand edits will be overwritten on the next regeneration.

**Releases:** 5 **Efforts:** 17 (1 unassigned) **Source:** every `plan.md` and `spec.md` under `docs/internal/release-plans/`, including `_unassigned/`, plus each effort's `implementation-plan.md` where present

## Series Legend

Every effort id's letter prefix names which series it belongs to. An id whose letter is not listed here is a generator bug, not a rendering gap: the generator refuses to run rather than leave the meaning blank.

| Letter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| D | defect in the wrap and continue pair |
| W | wrap-session roadmap item |
| C | continue-session roadmap item |
| CI | continuous integration |
| A | ai-review roadmap item |
| H | hygiene and repo-wide |

## Unassigned Efforts

Specs written before being assigned to a release: the documented default home `/plab-spec` writes into when `--target-release` is omitted (`docs/internal/release-plans/_unassigned/`). These carry no target version until `/plab-release-plan --promote` moves the whole effort folder into a release. `_unassigned/` does not exist on disk until the first spec is written there; its absence is normal, not an error.

| Effort | Handle | Series | Spec Status | Implementation Plan Status | Priority | Human Review Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [A-02](_unassigned/A-02_programmatic-review-dispatch/spec.md) | programmatic review dispatch | A (ai-review roadmap item) | draft | (no implementation plan yet) | P1 | No |
