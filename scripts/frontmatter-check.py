Field-validity gate for document frontmatter under docs/internal/release-plans/.

EXIT-CODE CONTRACT
------------------
  0  CLEAN    self-test passed AND every scanned frontmatter block validates against its schema
  1  FINDINGS self-test passed AND at least one frontmatter block fails its schema
  2  BROKEN   the detector could not prove itself, or an input could not be read

NEVER INTERPRET 2 AS CLEAN. See `scripts/check-dashes.py` and `skills/plab-wrap-session/scripts/path-citation-check.py` for the two prior gates this one matches in shape, and `docs/internal/release-plans/plan_04_gates-that-cannot-fail-open/D-11_three-state-gate-canaries/spec.md` for why this repository insists on the three-state contract at all.

No unexpected exception is ever allowed to surface as exit 1. `main()` is wrapped at the very bottom of this file: any exception this script did not anticipate and handle explicitly is reported as BROKEN and exits 2, never 1. Exit 1 means, and only means, "the detector proved itself and then found a real problem in a document." An uncaught exception means the detector never got that far, so it cannot mean the same thing as a finding.

WHAT THIS CATCHES
------------------
A spec, implementation plan, or release plan whose frontmatter has drifted from the contract every downstream reader assumes: a status value outside the enum, a date or version string in the wrong shape, a field silently missing, a field nobody documented sitting in the block. None of that is visible from a normal read of the rendered markdown body, and a human skimming past the frontmatter block during a plain-language document review is exactly the failure mode this gate exists to remove. This is the field-validity half of the document lifecycle gate (effort H-01); it does not check cross-document consistency (an `ac-count` that disagrees with the actual `AC-N:` entries in the body, a `linked-release` path that does not resolve) - only that each field, taken alone, has the right shape.

THE SCHEMA FILES ARE DETECTOR CONFIGURATION, NOT SCAN INPUT
-------------------------------------------------------------
The three JSON Schema files in `docs/internal/schemas/` are always loaded from that fixed, script-relative location, never from `--root`. They are part of this detector in the same sense that `check-dashes.py`'s `PATTERN` constant is part of that detector: a fixed instrument, not a document being validated. `--root` controls only which `docs/internal/release-plans/` tree gets scanned, matching `--repo-root` in `path-citation-check.py`, whose docstring makes the same distinction between the project being scanned and the tool's own installed location. Because the schemas are detector configuration, `self_test()` below loads and exercises the real, committed schema files rather than a duplicate copy - a second, hand-maintained copy embedded in this script would be exactly the kind of two-sources-of-truth setup that drifts silently and is never caught, which is what canary discipline exists to prevent. Only the documents being validated (the synthetic `.md` fixtures with frontmatter) are built fresh inside a `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` and never touch the real repository, so a clean self-test does not depend on which project happens to be under the cursor.

THE SMALL JSON SCHEMA SUBSET THIS VALIDATOR IMPLEMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------
Exactly: `required`, `type` (the values `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, `null`, or a JSON array of any of those - e.g. `["string", "null"]` for a nullable field), `enum`, `pattern`, `additionalProperties: false`, `properties`, and `items` (carrying only `type`). `$schema` is read and ignored as metadata. This is not a general JSON Schema engine and must never grow into pretending to be one; see `docs/internal/schemas/README.md` for why the schema files themselves stay within this subset (no `const`, no `"type": "object"` at the root) even though nothing stops a future editor from reaching for a keyword outside it. Only the three schema files this script maps `type` values to (`spec.schema.json`, `implementation-plan.schema.json`, `release-plan.schema.json` - see `SCHEMA_FILES` below) are ever opened; a stray file dropped into `docs/internal/schemas/` under a different name is never read and is not part of this contract. If one of the three mapped schema files uses a keyword this validator does not implement - at any nesting depth, inside `properties` or `items` - the whole run exits 2 (BROKEN) before a single document is scanned. Silently ignoring an unrecognized keyword would mean validating less than the schema claims while still reporting success, which is a fail-open and is exactly the class of defect this repository refuses to ship (see the ripgrep and Perl failures documented in `scripts/check-dashes.py`, a different mechanism producing the identical false-clean shape).

THE COERCION RULE IS SCHEMA-AWARE, NOT GRAMMAR-BASED
---------------------------------------------------------
The frontmatter parser below reads plain text, so every value starts life as a string. A quoted value is never coerced, even if it looks numeric or boolean, because quoting it was the author's way of saying "this is text." For a bare (unquoted) token, coercion is driven by what the *target property's schema* declares, not by the token's own spelling: a bare token is coerced to a Python int only when the schema for that field declares `"integer"` (directly, or as one member of a list-valued `"type"`), and to a Python bool only when the schema declares `"boolean"`. A bare token is never coerced to int or bool against a field whose schema says `"string"`.

This is a deliberate rejection of an earlier, grammar-based rule ("any bare token matching JSON's integer grammar becomes an int") that looked reasonable in isolation but broke on this repository's own documents: `sequence` is schema-typed `"string"` with `"pattern": "^\\d{2}$"` specifically so a two-digit, possibly-leading-zero folder ordinal round-trips as text. A grammar-based rule coerced `sequence: 10` (no leading zero) to the integer `10`, which then failed the schema's own `"string"` type check - a false positive that first bites at release plan 10, while `04` through `09` passed only because a leading zero happens to block the same grammar match. Schema-aware coercion removes the leading-zero special case entirely: every bare `sequence` value, `04` through `99`, stays a string because the schema says `"string"`, and every field genuinely typed `"integer"` (`ac-count`, `phase-count`, `spec-count`, and so on) still coerces correctly regardless of leading zero, because JSON's own integer grammar (`-?(0|[1-9]\\d*)`) never matches a leading-zero token in the first place - so `04` under an `"integer"` schema is a bare token that fails to coerce and is correctly reported as a type violation, not silently accepted as `4`.

One token is coerced unconditionally, independent of the target schema: the bare word `null` always becomes Python `None`. This is deliberately NOT schema-gated. Gating it (coercing to `None` only when the field's schema allows a `"null"` type) would reproduce, rather than fix, exactly the inconsistency this rule replaces: previously a bare `null` on an unpatterned string field passed silently (it is a valid four-character string), while the identical bare `null` on a patterned field like `created` failed the pattern - two different outcomes for the same input, depending on an implementation detail the author had no visibility into. Unconditional coercion to `None` makes the outcome depend only on whether the field's schema actually permits `null` (see the next section) - consistent for every field, patterned or not.

List items are routed through this exact same coercion function, using the array field's `items` schema as the per-item target type. `includes` and `spec-dependencies` both declare `items: {"type": "string"}`, so a bare numeric or boolean-looking item in one of those lists is left as a string by the same schema-aware logic described above - consistent with `sequence`, not an exception to it. A bare `null` item, however, still coerces unconditionally to `None`, and then correctly fails the `items: {"type": "string"}` check, because `None` is not a string. This is proof the routing works in both directions: schema-typed-string items are never wrongly coerced away from their valid string reading, while a token that cannot be a string under any reading (`null`) is still caught.

NULLABLE FIELDS: LIST-VALUED "type" AND THE "null" TYPE
-------------------------------------------------------------
`"type"` may be a single value or a JSON array of values, e.g. `["string", "null"]`. An instance validates if it matches ANY type in the list. `"null"` is a supported type value; an instance matches it only when it is Python `None`. This repository writes literal `null` into a spec's `linked-plan`, `linked-release`, and `target-release` before those facts exist (see `skills/plab-spec/references/frontmatter-schema.md` and `skills/plab-release-plan/references/promote-demote.md`, which clears both fields back to `null` on `--demote`), and into an implementation plan's `linked-release` for the same reason, so those four fields are schema-typed `["string", "null"]` rather than plain `"string"`.

WHY DOCUMENTS ARE READ WITH utf-8-sig
-----------------------------------------
A file saved on Windows can carry a UTF-8 byte-order mark. Read with plain `utf-8`, that BOM attaches to the first line, so a frontmatter block that legitimately opens with `---` reads instead as `\\ufeff---`, fails the opening-fence check, and the file is silently skipped as if it carried no frontmatter at all - a validated file quietly downgrading into an ignored one, with no finding and no BROKEN, which is a fail-open by omission. `utf-8-sig` strips a leading BOM when present and is byte-identical to `utf-8` when one is absent, so every document is read that way below. A file that is not valid UTF-8 at all (for example one saved as cp1252 and carrying a byte no UTF-8 sequence can start with) raises `UnicodeDecodeError` on that same read; this is caught alongside `OSError` and reported as BROKEN for that file, per the general exception rule above - never as an uncaught traceback and never as a silent skip.

BROKEN VS. A FINDING: WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN
--------------------------------------------------
BROKEN (exit 2) is reserved for the detector itself: self-test failing, `docs/internal/schemas/` missing or containing a schema file that will not parse as JSON or uses an unsupported keyword, the `docs/internal/release-plans/` scan root missing under `--root`, a directory under the scan root that cannot be listed at the OS level (permissions, a vanished mount - `os.walk()` is given an `onerror` callback that re-raises rather than the default of silently swallowing the error), zero files found to check or skip when a clean result is otherwise about to be printed (an emptied, moved, or misdirected scan surface must never read as a clean tree), an OS-level failure opening a `.md` file, or that file's bytes failing to decode as UTF-8 at all. A single document whose *content* does not conform to the flat `key: value` frontmatter shape this repository uses (an unclosed `---` fence, a line that is not `key: value`, a duplicate key, a `type` field that is missing or names no known schema) is reported as a FINDING against that one file, not BROKEN: the detector proved itself fine via self-test, the failure is a property of that one input document, and it does not stop the rest of the scan. Every other `.md` file under the scan root is still checked.

SKIPPING FILES WITH NO FRONTMATTER IS DELIBERATE
----------------------------------------------------
A `.md` file whose first non-blank line is not a `---` fence (for example `docs/internal/release-plans/README.md`) is skipped, not flagged. Leading blank or whitespace-only lines before the fence do not exempt a file: a file whose first non-blank line IS the opening `---` fence is a frontmatter file, full stop, and is scanned exactly as if the fence were on line 1. A schema describes the shape of frontmatter that is present; it says nothing about whether a given file is required to carry frontmatter at all, and that question belongs to a different check, not this one.

COMMENTS INSIDE THE FRONTMATTER BLOCK
------------------------------------------
A line whose first non-whitespace character is `#` is a full-line comment and is skipped, exactly like a blank line. A `key: value` line may also carry a trailing comment - `key: value  # note` - stripped from an unquoted position (a `#` inside a quoted string is just a character in that string, never the start of a comment). `skills/plab-spec/references/frontmatter-schema.md`'s own worked example uses exactly this trailing-comment style on `linked-effort`, so an author copying that example must not have the comment silently baked into the field's value.

WHAT PER-TYPE FRONTMATTER IS REQUIRED VS. OPTIONAL FOLLOWS THE REPO'S OWN AUTHORING CONTRACT, NOT THE FULLEST DOCUMENT ON DISK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`spec.schema.json`'s required list matches exactly what `skills/plab-spec/references/frontmatter-schema.md` documents as required for a spec: `id`, `title`, `type`, `status`, `created`, `updated`, `linked-effort`, `ac-count`. Every other field that reference documents - `linked-plan`, `linked-release`, `source-count`, `requires-human-review`, `priority`, `target-release`, `gh-issue`, `spec-dependencies`, `linked-strategy-brief`, `superseded-by` - is optional: its shape is still enforced when the field is present, but its absence is not a finding. A spec sitting in `_unassigned/` (see `skills/plab-spec/SKILL.md`) genuinely has no release and no target version yet, which is exactly the case `--target-release` being omitted describes, and this schema must not flag that spec for a fact of its lifecycle stage rather than a defect in its frontmatter.
