Version-parity gate: every version a tracked document CLAIMS must equal the version the repository DECLARES.

EXIT-CODE CONTRACT
------------------
  0  CLEAN    self-test passed AND every claimed version matched its authoritative source
  1  FINDINGS self-test passed AND at least one document claims a version that disagrees with the source
  2  BROKEN   the detector could not prove itself, a file could not be parsed, a location this script is supposed to read yielded no claims at all, or any other exception reached the top level

NEVER INTERPRET 2 AS CLEAN. `scripts/doc-lifecycle-check.py` and `scripts/check-dashes.py` carry the same contract; this script applies it to the one thing neither of them can see, which is whether the prose agrees with `library.json` and with each `skills/*/SKILL.md`.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
----------------------
v0.5.3 shipped with six stale version references in `README.md` and `docs/status-skills.md`. They were found by hand during the release and fixed there, but nothing mechanical had flagged them and nothing mechanical would have.

The gap was wider than the session log that recorded it suggested. The "bidirectional drift check" that was believed to cover this (`skills/plab-wrap-session/references/hygiene-sweep.md`, Check 4, delivered by D-03) is a bash recipe inside a skill reference document, run by an agent during a session wrap. Two consequences follow, and both matter more than the missing file coverage:

  1. **CI has never run it.** It is not a committed script and no workflow invokes it. A version reference can therefore be stale on `main` indefinitely, through any number of green pull requests, until someone happens to wrap a session.
  2. **It checks a different thing.** Check 4 compares each skill's own `metadata.version` at HEAD against its value at the last tag, and looks for a `HISTORY.md` row. It never reads the version numbers written in the documentation at all. The usage-README comparison in that reference is under "Stale docs, caught by reading", which is a human instruction, not a check.

So this script does not extend Check 4; it covers what Check 4 was mistakenly believed to cover, mechanically and in CI. Check 4 remains useful and unchanged: it answers "should this version have been bumped", which is a question about git history that this script deliberately does not ask.

WHY THIS IS A STRUCTURAL CHECK AND NOT A VERSION-STRING SWEEP
------------------------------------------------------------
The obvious implementation, "find every `\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+` in the tracked docs and compare it to something", is the implementation this repository already knows not to write. D-12's path-citation rule scored 13 flags with 11 false positives when a prose rule was mechanized literally (`docs/internal/release-plans/plan_04_gates-that-cannot-fail-open/D-12_path-citation-precision/spec.md`), and the lesson kept from it is "mechanize the structure, never the prose". Version-shaped strings in these documents are overwhelmingly historical: HISTORY tables, "carried through 1.2.1", changelog entries. Every one of those is correct precisely because it does NOT match the current version.

This script therefore reads exactly four structured locations, each of which is a claim about what a version IS RIGHT NOW, and ignores every other version-shaped string in the repository:

  L1  `README.md`, the Skills table. A row whose first cell links a `plab-*` skill claims that skill's current version.
  L2  `docs/status-skills.md`, the At a glance table. Same row shape, same claim.
  L3  `docs/skills/<skill>/README.md`, the `**Version:**` line near the top. One per usage README.
  L4  `docs/status-skills.md`, the `**Plugin version:**` line. A claim about `library.json`'s version, not a skill's.

Authoritative sources, never the other way round: a skill's version is whatever `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` says in `metadata.version`, and the library's version is whatever `library.json` says in `version`. This script never edits either, and never edits the documents; CI reports, it does not fix (`AGENTS.md`, Build and validate).

WHY AN UNPARSEABLE LOCATION IS BROKEN, NOT CLEAN
------------------------------------------------
Each of L1, L2 and L3 is matched by a shape. If someone reformats the Skills table, or renames the `**Version:**` label, the matcher stops finding claims and this gate goes quiet while the documents drift freely. A gate that reports CLEAN because it has gone blind is worse than no gate, and this repository has been bitten by that exact failure twice: the empty `git tag -l` in v0.5.2, and `AGENTS.md` never loading in the superpowers experiment.

So a location that yields ZERO claims when the repository has skills to claim is BROKEN, not clean. A location that yields SOME claims but is missing a particular skill is a FINDING, because that is real drift: a skill exists and the documentation does not list it.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
--------------------------------------------
Whether a version SHOULD have been bumped (Check 4's question, and one that needs git history). Whether `HISTORY.md` has a row for the current version (also Check 4). Whether the generated manifests agree with `library.json`, which is the toolkit's `gen-manifest.mjs` and its own parity gate. Whether a version number is semantically the right increment. And any version-shaped string outside the four locations above, all of which are presumed historical and correct.
