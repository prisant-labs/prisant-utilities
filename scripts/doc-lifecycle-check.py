Cross-file document lifecycle gate for docs/internal/release-plans/.

EXIT-CODE CONTRACT
------------------
  0  CLEAN    self-test passed AND no cross-file invariant was violated
  1  FINDINGS self-test passed AND at least one invariant was violated
  2  BROKEN   the detector could not prove itself, a doc could not be parsed, git tag -l failed, git tag -l returned no tags without an explicit opt-in, or any other exception this script did not anticipate reached the top level

NEVER INTERPRET 2 AS CLEAN. See `scripts/check-dashes.py` and `skills/plab-wrap-session/scripts/path-citation-check.py` for the same contract applied to a repo-wide grep and a single-log scan; this script applies it to the relationships between the sixteen spec/implementation-plan pairs and the five release plans that no single file's own frontmatter can see.

Exit 1 means, and only means, that the detector proved itself and then found a real cross-file problem. No unexpected exception may ever surface as exit 1: `main()` wraps the whole run in a single top-level handler, so any exception this script did not specifically anticipate and convert to a sys.exit(2) of its own is still reported as BROKEN and still exits 2, never falls through to Python's default uncaught-exception behavior (which exits 1 and would be indistinguishable from a real finding).

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A JSON SCHEMA
---------------------------------------------------------
A JSON Schema, or any per-file validator, checks a document against itself: does this file's frontmatter have the right keys, the right types, a status from the right enum. It cannot see that another file claims to supersede this one and this one has never heard of it, that two release plans both claim the same target version, or that a spec still reads `draft` for a release that has already shipped and been tagged. Those are relationships between files, or between a file and git state, and the maintainer was bitten by exactly one of them: a supersession declared in only one direction, found by hand during the 2026-08-25 `_local` documentation review (`_local/hygiene/2026-08-25_local-docs-review.md`, Section 1, "A live supersession asymmetry"). This script exists to catch that class mechanically instead of by a full manual read every few weeks.

WHY EVERY CHECK HERE IS MECHANICAL, WITH NO JUDGMENT CALLS
-------------------------------------------------------------
The same review (Section 5) measured what happens when a judgment rule gets mechanized anyway: D-12's path-citation rule, which reads fine as prose because a human applies sense to it, scored 13 flags with 11 false positives once written as a literal script (`docs/internal/release-plans/plan_04_gates-that-cannot-fail-open/D-12_path-citation-precision/spec.md`). The lesson kept here is "mechanize the lifecycle fields, never the content judgment": every check below compares a field to another field, a field to a filesystem fact, or a field to git state, and none of them read prose for meaning. The acceptance-criteria count check was nearly dropped for the same reason; it shipped only after an empirical sweep of all sixteen real specs AND the spec-template.md / example specs under skills/plab-spec/references/ found that exactly two checklist forms cover every one of them with zero exceptions (the bare `- [ ] AC-N:` form the sixteen real specs use, and the `- [ ] **AC-N** -` form the template and its examples document as what the generator itself produces), while both forms are read only outside fenced code blocks so a spec that quotes AC syntax as a documentation example is not double-counted.

WHY EVERY SUBPROCESS BOUNDARY PINS encoding="utf-8"
-----------------------------------------------------
`scripts/check-dashes.py`'s docstring records the failure this guards against: Python's subprocess text mode defaults to the locale encoding, which is cp1252 on this maintainer's machine, and cp1252 cannot represent the same bytes UTF-8 can, so an unpinned subprocess call can silently see nothing to match and report a clean result that is really a broken one. The `git tag -l` call below pins `encoding="utf-8"` for the same reason, and so does every `open()` call in this file. A file that is not valid UTF-8 is reported as a named, path-specific BROKEN finding rather than an uncaught traceback.

WHY AN EMPTY `git tag -l` IS BROKEN, NOT CLEAN
---------------------------------------------------
Invariant 4 (released-but-unfulfilled) can only fire against tags that are actually present. A default GitHub Actions checkout (`actions/checkout`) fetches no tags at all unless `fetch-tags: true` is set or a later step runs `git fetch --tags`, so an empty tag list is far more often a starved checkout than a repository that has genuinely never tagged a release. If an empty tag list were treated as "no violations found," invariant 4 would pass CLEAN on every CI run by construction, proving nothing, silently. So an empty tag list is BROKEN unless `--allow-no-tags` is passed explicitly, for the one genuine case: a repository that really has never tagged.

WHY EACH INVARIANT'S FIXTURE IS BUILT IN ITS OWN tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`self_test()` below never touches this repository. Each of the nine invariants gets its own small, throwaway fixture tree containing exactly one seeded violation (a canary, which must be flagged) alongside at least one correctly-shaped sibling (an anti-canary, which must not be). That keeps this gate's trustworthiness independent of whatever `docs/internal/release-plans/` happens to look like on the machine it runs on, which is the same discipline `path-citation-check.py` documents under "The self-test never touches --repo-root." On top of the nine per-check fixtures, one more fixture drives the checks through `run_all_checks()` itself, the same top-level entry point the real run uses, seeded with one violation of every invariant at once, so a check silently missing from the shipped pipeline is caught even though each check function still passes its own isolated test. And the invariant-4 tag-availability gate is proved separately, as a pure decision function with no git and no filesystem, against all three of its branches (tags present, tags absent without the opt-in, tags absent with the opt-in).

THE NINE INVARIANTS
----------------------
  1. Supersession symmetry, both directions: if a document declares `superseded-by: X`, a document with `id: X` must exist and must declare `supersedes:` back naming this document's own id; if a document declares `supersedes: Y`, a document with `id: Y` must exist and must declare `superseded-by:` back naming this document's own id. Checked across specs, implementation plans, AND release plans, not just the first two: this is a field-to-field comparison, not a per-file-type rule, so a release plan carrying either field is checked exactly like a spec.
  2. No two release plans may declare the same `target-version`.
  3. No two release plans may declare the same `sequence`.
  4. A spec whose `target-release` is already an existing git tag must be `fulfilled` or `superseded`, never still `draft` or `committed`. This invariant is only as trustworthy as the tag list it is checked against; see "WHY AN EMPTY git tag -l IS BROKEN, NOT CLEAN" above.
  5. Every `linked-spec`, `linked-plan` and `linked-release` value must resolve to a real FILE (not a directory), tried first relative to the citing file's own directory and then relative to the repo root, since this repository stores some of these paths one way and some the other. A non-string value (for example a list) is itself a finding, not a silently skipped field. Checked across specs, implementation plans, AND release plans. `linked-effort` is deliberately never checked here: the schema allows it to be a plain-language description of an untracked source rather than a path, and a tracked document is not permitted to cite an untracked one (`skills/plab-spec/references/frontmatter-schema.md`, `linked-effort` row).
  6. An effort folder named like `D-07_waiting-on-blocker-contract` must contain a `spec.md` whose `id` is `D-07`, and the `implementation-plan.md` beside it must carry the same `id`.
  7. A release plan's `spec-count` and `plan-count` must equal the number of `spec.md` and `implementation-plan.md` files present in that release plan's effort folders, and its `includes` list must name exactly the effort ids whose folders are present there. "Effort folder" has exactly one definition in this script, used for both halves of this invariant and for invariant 6: an immediate subdirectory of the release plan's own folder, matching the `ID_slug` naming convention (`effort_dirs_of()`). Nothing deeper than that is counted, matching the documented convention that effort subfolders are peers of `plan.md`, not an arbitrarily deep tree.
  8. A spec's `ac-count` must equal the number of AC checklist lines in its body, outside fenced code blocks, counting either of two forms: `- [ ] AC-N: <text>` (what the sixteen real specs in this repository use) or `- [ ] **AC-N** - <text>` (what `skills/plab-spec/references/spec-template.md` and its example specs document as the generator's own output).
  9. A spec's `status` and its acceptance-criteria checkboxes must agree: a `fulfilled` spec must have every AC checkbox ticked, and a `draft` spec must have none ticked. `committed` and `superseded` are deliberately not checked, for a reason that is empirical rather than an oversight; see `check_ac_status_agreement()`. Invariants 8 and 9 read the same checkbox lines through the same regex and therefore cannot disagree about what an acceptance criterion is: 8 counts them, 9 reads their state.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
------------------------------------------------
Per-file frontmatter shape (required keys, enum membership, type correctness) is a JSON Schema's job, not this script's; a file this script cannot even locate a frontmatter block in, or cannot decode as UTF-8, is treated as BROKEN rather than silently skipped, because a parser that returns an empty result for a malformed file and calls that clean is the exact failure the three-state contract exists to rule out. Whether a roadmap's reasoning still holds, whether a status change was the right call, and whether a document should exist at all are judgment calls the 2026-08-25 review names explicitly as things a gate must never try to answer; this script answers none of them.

This script's flat-frontmatter parser deliberately supports only 'key: value' lines, an inline '[a, b]' list, a quoted or bare scalar, and a trailing '# comment' stripped the way real YAML strips one (only when the '#' is preceded by whitespace or starts the value, and never inside quotes). A YAML block sequence (a 'key:' line followed by '- item' lines, indented or not) is NOT supported: rather than silently parsing to an empty value and producing a false "missing from includes" finding, this script fails loud, reporting the document as BROKEN with a named line and a rewrite-as-inline remedy.

A `fulfilled` spec asserts that every criterion was delivered, so every AC checkbox must be ticked; a `draft` spec has not had its contract agreed yet, so none may be. Both directions are real defect shapes rather than tidiness: a fulfilled spec with an unticked criterion claims delivery it never verified, and a draft spec with a ticked one claims delivery before anyone agreed what delivery meant.

    `committed` and `superseded` are deliberately NOT checked, and that is empirical rather than an oversight. `committed` is the one status a spec legitimately holds while its implementation plan is mid-execution, so a partial tick count there is the correct state and not a defect; checking it would false-flag exactly the window this repository is about to spend building A-02, whose spec is currently the only committed spec in the tree. `superseded` is a dead end whose ticks no longer assert anything about a live contract. A status this function does not recognise is reported rather than skipped, so widening the schema enum without widening this invariant cannot make it pass silently.

    A spec with zero AC lines passes vacuously. Whether a spec should carry criteria at all is invariant 8's business (`ac-count` against the body) and, before that, the JSON Schema's; this invariant only compares state that exists.

    Measured across the whole corpus on 2026-09-04, before the rule was written: 8 fulfilled specs at 52 of 52 ticked, 8 draft specs at 0 of 61, and 1 committed spec at 0 of 9. The record was already perfect and enforced by nothing, which is the reason to build the fixture while it still is."""
