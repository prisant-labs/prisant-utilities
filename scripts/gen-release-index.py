"""
Generates docs/internal/release-plans/INDEX.md, the cross-release effort index. Nothing else in this repository shows every effort across every release at a glance: the release plan (plan.md) aggregates only within its own release, so a maintainer wanting the whole picture has to open five folders and sixteen spec files by hand. This script derives that picture from frontmatter alone, on every run, so the index can never carry a fact that disk does not also carry.

EXIT-CODE CONTRACT
------------------
0  CLEAN    self-test passed AND (generate mode: the file was written; or --check mode: the committed INDEX.md matches what generation produces right now)
1  FINDINGS self-test passed AND --check found the committed INDEX.md out of date, including the case where INDEX.md does not exist yet (a missing index is out of date, not unreadable input)
2  BROKEN   the self-test could not prove the generator trustworthy, an input file could not be read or parsed, a documented naming or content rule was actually violated (a would-be release or effort folder with the wrong name but real content inside it, an empty required field, an unrecognised boolean spelling), an effort id's series letter is not in the legend map, or any other exception the generator did not anticipate. The top-level dispatcher converts every unanticipated exception to BROKEN rather than let it surface as a bare traceback, which the OS reports as exit 1 and which this contract reserves for "the detector proved itself and found a real problem."

NEVER INTERPRET 2 AS CLEAN. See scripts/check-dashes.py and skills/plab-wrap-session/scripts/path-citation-check.py for the same contract applied elsewhere in this repository.

WHY AN UNKNOWN SERIES LETTER IS EXIT 2, NOT A BLANK CELL
---------------------------------------------------------
The series legend (D, W, C, CI, A, H) is documented nowhere machine-readable except this script. If an effort folder appears with a letter the legend does not cover, silently rendering a blank meaning cell is exactly how an undocumented convention survives unnoticed: the table still looks complete, so nobody goes looking for what the letter means. The generator refuses to render that cell at all. This is proven by a canary that walks a full fixture tree containing an unmapped letter through build_model() itself, not only through the leaf function that owns the map, because the failure this guards against lives in the wiring between the two: a map that is correct but never consulted would pass a leaf-only test and still ship a blank cell.

WHY A NON-EFFORT SIBLING DIRECTORY IS IGNORED, NOT BROKEN
------------------------------------------------------------
A release folder can legitimately hold subdirectories that are not efforts: a documented sibling skill may drop working material next to the per-effort folders it manages. Treating every subdirectory as an effort and then failing on the missing spec.md it does not have makes the generator, and any --check gate built on it, brittle about a normal repository state. An effort is instead recognised by its documented name shape, a series letter and number followed by an underscore and a slug, e.g. "D-03_bidirectional-drift-check". A directory that does not match that shape is skipped, UNLESS it contains a spec.md of its own: that is unambiguous evidence someone meant it as an effort folder and misnamed it, so it fails loud rather than silently dropping a real effort from the index. The identical policy applies one level up, in discover_release_dirs(), using plan.md as the equivalent tell for a release folder.

WHY A MISSING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS NOT AN ERROR
------------------------------------------------------
A spec is routinely written before its implementation plan; that gap is a normal, documented intermediate state of the work, not a corrupt input. Hard-requiring implementation-plan.md to exist turned that ordinary state into exit 2 BROKEN, which blocks a release for a situation that is not an error at all. When the file is absent, the effort's row still renders, with its plan-status cell carrying an explicit marker (PLAN_STATUS_NOT_WRITTEN below) rather than a value read from a file that was never written. When the file IS present, its status field is still required and still must be non-empty: presence of the file is what makes "no plan yet" cross over into "a plan exists, and it must say what its status is."

WHY _unassigned/ IS ITS OWN GROUP IN THE INDEX
--------------------------------------------------
docs/internal/release-plans/_unassigned/ is the documented default home a new spec lands in before it is promoted into a release (see skills/plab-spec/SKILL.md and skills/plab-release-plan/references/promote-demote.md). It holds effort folders directly, the same "<id>_<slug>" shape as inside a release, but with no plan.md above them and so no release-level target-version to source from: an unassigned effort's Target Version cell reads "-", never the spec's own target-release field, for the same reason plan.md and not spec.md is the source of truth for that column elsewhere in this file (see below). _unassigned/ does not exist on disk until the first spec is written into it; a generator that treated that absence as an error would fail on every fresh clone of this repository, so absence is handled as the normal empty case, not a failure.

WHY THE INDEX CARRIES NO GENERATION DATE
-----------------------------------------
The precedent in docs/status-skills.md stamps an "As of:" date because a human maintains that file by hand and the date records when they last checked it against reality. This file is not maintained by hand; it is a pure function of the frontmatter under docs/internal/release-plans/. Adding today's date would make --check report FINDINGS every single day even when not one byte of source frontmatter changed, which defeats the freshness gate rather than serving it: a gate that cries wolf daily trains its reader to ignore it. Freshness here means "matches current frontmatter", not "was regenerated recently", and git history already answers the second question for whoever wants it.

WHY --check NORMALIZES LINE ENDINGS BEFORE COMPARING
------------------------------------------------------
This repository has core.autocrlf=true and no .gitattributes. A file committed with LF checks out as CRLF on this maintainer's Windows machine and stays LF on ubuntu-latest. That is a platform artifact of the checkout, not a content change, and comparing raw bytes would make --check report FINDINGS purely because of which OS last checked the file out, which is the same "detector flags the wrong thing" failure mode the dash-check docstring describes for a different cause. --check reads the committed file with newline="" (so no translation happens twice) and normalizes CRLF to LF on that side only before comparing against the freshly generated text, which this script always writes with newline="\n" so its own output is LF exactly once. A self-test canary proves that content differing only by line ending compares as current.

TARGET VERSION COMES FROM plan.md, NOT FROM EACH SPEC
--------------------------------------------------------
Every spec.md in this repository also carries its own target-release field, and today it is identical to its release's plan.md target-version in all sixteen cases (verified by hand before writing this script). The Target Version column is sourced from plan.md's target-version because that is a release-level fact stated once, in the file whose job is to state it; a spec's target-release is that same fact copied onto sixteen other files, and a generator should read a fact from where it is authoritative, not from every place it happens to also appear. This is also why an unassigned effort's Target Version cell is "-" rather than its spec's target-release: there is no plan.md yet to be the authoritative source.

PARSING
-------
Frontmatter in this repository is flat: "key: value" lines between a pair of "---" fences, plus occasional quoted strings and "[a, b]" inline lists. parse_frontmatter() below is a small purpose-built line parser for exactly that shape. It is not a YAML parser and must never grow into one; this repository has deliberately never had a package.json or any dependency manifest, and stdlib-only is a project-wide constraint, not a preference for this script.
