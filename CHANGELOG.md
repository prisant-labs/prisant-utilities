# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

### Added

- Initial public release with five skills: `plab-wrap-session` 1.4.0, `plab-continue-session` 1.2.0, `plab-strategy-brief` 1.1.1, `plab-guide` 2.2.1, `plab-ai-review` 1.2.1.
- Shared plugin-root utilities: `lib/render-mermaid.py`, `references/diagrams.md`, `references/decisions-section.md`.
- Per-skill usage documentation under `docs/skills/`.
- `library.json` as the canonical manifest, with native Claude Code and Codex manifests generated from it.

### Notes

Skills were previously developed in a private library and carry their version numbers forward unchanged. Per-skill `HISTORY.md` files start at the migrated version and record what changed for public release; earlier history remains private.

The default output root for generated artifacts is `_output/<skill-name>/`, replacing a brand-named folder used privately.
