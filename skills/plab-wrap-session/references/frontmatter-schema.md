# Frontmatter Schema Reference

The session log YAML frontmatter has 3 tiers. Always include Tier 1. Add Tier 2 and Tier 3 when the data is available.

---

## Tier 1: Essential (Always Include)

All fields are auto-derivable from the environment.

| Field | Type | How to Derive | Example |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|
| `date` | ISO 8601 datetime | System clock | `2026-04-05T14:30:00-07:00` |
| `type` | const | Always `session-log` (per document-conventions.md §2.4) | `session-log` |
| `machine` | String | `hostname` - which checkout wrote this log (logs are machine-local) | `dev-laptop` |
| `repo` | String | `git remote -v` or directory name | `acme/example-repo` |
| `branch` | String | `git branch --show-current` | `main` |
| `summary` | String (≤120 chars) | Agent generates from session context | `"Deployed strategy-brief skill and CI pipeline"` |
| `files-changed` | List of paths | `git diff --name-only` | `["skills/plab-strategy-brief/SKILL.md"]` |

## Tier 2: High Value (When Available)

| Field | Type | How to Derive | Auto? |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| `session-type` | Enum | Agent assesses from work done | Semi - suggest, user overrides |
| `parent-session` | Filename | Most recent session log in same repo/branch | Semi - suggest if found |
| `model` | String | Full model name (e.g., "claude opus 4.6", "codex gpt 5.4") | Auto |
| `model-settings` | String | Key settings active during session (e.g., "extended-thinking max", "fast mode") | Auto when detectable |
| `agent` | Enum | Environment detection (claude-code, codex-cli, etc.) | Auto |
| `status` | Enum | How session ended | Semi - agent assesses |
| `decisions-count` | Integer | Count from decisions section | Auto |
| `skills-used` | List | Skills invoked during the session (usage telemetry; feeds pruning decisions) | Semi - agent recalls, user corrects |
| `resumed-from` | Filename | The session log this session resumed from via /plab-continue-session, if any (measures log consumption) | Auto when resumption happened |

### Session Types

`bugfix` | `feature` | `refactor` | `research` | `planning` | `review` | `docs` | `autonomous` | `exploration`

### Status Values

`completed` | `interrupted` | `blocked` | `in-progress`

## Tier 3: Nice to Have (When Applicable)

| Field | Type | How to Derive |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `duration-minutes` | Integer | Estimate from session context |
| `tokens-used` | Integer | From `/cost` or `/usage` if available |
| `commit-sha` | String | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` |
| `tags` | List | Agent suggests from session topics |
| `related-issues` | List | Agent detects issue references |
| `transcript-path` | String | Platform-specific transcript location |
| `adrs-created` | List of filenames | ADRs created this session (e.g., `[0008-centralize-session-logs.md, 0009-adopt-madr.md]`) |

```

## Filename Convention

Session logs are written to a centralized directory:

```
_local/_session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<llm>_<brief-kebab-title>.md
```

| Component | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2026-04-08` |
| Time | `HH-MM` (24h) | `09-36` |
| LLM | Short name | `claude`, `codex`, `gpt`, `gemini` |
| Title | kebab-case | `deploy-ai-review` |

All agents write to the same `_local/_session-logs/` directory. The LLM short name in the filename identifies who did the work. Full model details (name, version, settings) go in the frontmatter, not the filename.

## Citing another session log

Reference other logs **by filename only**, never by directory-qualified path. This applies to `resumed-from:`, to evidence tables, and to prose anywhere in the log.

- Correct: `2026-08-17_22-15_claude_migration-complete-t3-and-cutover.md`
- Wrong: `_local/_session-logs/2026-08-17_22-15_claude_migration-complete-t3-and-cutover.md`

The filename is the log's identity: unique, sortable, and stable. The directory is storage, and `/plab-wrap-session --organize` moves logs into `YYYY-MM/` folders once their month closes. A path-qualified reference breaks on that move; a filename never does.

This is why archiving needs no link-rewriting step, and therefore has no link-rewriting bugs. The durable fix for a reference a move can break is not to rewrite it on move, but to stop writing it that way.

## Field Dependencies

These Tier 1 fields are load-bearing for future hook matching (SessionStart injection):

- `date` - determines recency
- `repo` - prevents cross-repo contamination
- `branch` - scopes to current work stream

Getting these three right is more important than including all Tier 3 fields.
