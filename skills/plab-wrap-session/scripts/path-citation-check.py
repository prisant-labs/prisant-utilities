Path-citation gate for a drafted plab-wrap-session log.

EXIT-CODE CONTRACT
------------------
  0  CLEAN    self-test passed AND every in-scope citation resolves
  1  FINDINGS self-test passed AND at least one in-scope citation is missing
  2  BROKEN   the detector could not prove itself, or the log could not be
              read, or anything else unanticipated went wrong

NEVER INTERPRET 2 AS CLEAN. See the sibling `dash-check.py` docstring and
`docs/internal/release-plans/plan_04_gates-that-cannot-fail-open/D-11_three-state-gate-canaries/spec.md`.

Exit 1 means, and only means, that the detector ran to completion and proved
a real problem. Any exception this module did not anticipate is caught at
the top level (see the `__main__` guard at the bottom of this file) and
reported as BROKEN with exit 2, never allowed to fall through to Python's
default uncaught-exception exit status.

THE SUBJECT-MATCHING RULE
-------------------------
Only citations that assert a location are evaluated. The base rule comes from
`docs/internal/release-plans/plan_04_gates-that-cannot-fail-open/D-12_path-citation-precision/spec.md`:

  (a) contains a path separator      -> must exist, flagged when missing
  (b) backtick-wrapped, no separator -> resolved against the repo root;
                                        non-resolution is NOT a finding
  (c) neither signal                 -> prose, never evaluated at all

Branch (b) can never produce a finding by design. Naming a file is not the
same as claiming where it lives.

A citation is normalized before branch (a)/(b)/(c) is decided and before
resolution is attempted: a trailing line anchor (`:42`, `:42-50`) is
stripped, a leading elision of three or more dots is stripped, surrounding
sentence punctuation is stripped, and a trailing possessive (`'s` or the
typographic right single quote plus `s`) is stripped. What is being decided
is always "what file does this text name", not "what does this text look
like verbatim in the log".

WHY BRANCH (a) NEEDED NARROWING AGAIN (spec Revision 2, 2026-08-25)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"Contains a path separator" survives as prose because a reader applies
judgment. A script has none. Measured against a real session log while
implementing this gate:

  old gate, pre-D-12                    7 flags, 6 false
  D-12's rule mechanized as written    13 flags, 11 false
  this file's rule                      4 flags, 2 false

Separators appear in many things that make no claim about a file's location:
slash commands (`/plab-wrap-session`), repository slugs
(`prisant-labs/agent-plugins`), git refs (`origin/main`), globs
(`docs/skills/*/README.md`), template placeholders (`_inbox/<skill>.md`), and
URLs. Shipping the unnarrowed rule would have put a detector that fails loud
into a release themed on detectors that fail open, at a worse false-positive
rate than the gate it replaces.

`is_path_claim()` below is the resulting test. Every exclusion is mechanical,
with no per-citation judgment. See D-12 spec Revisions for the superseded
criterion and the maintainer decision authorising this.

WHY THE MATCHER NEEDED THREE MORE FIXES (BUG-2, 2026-08-28)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Three false positives survived the D-12 narrowing, each caught by running
this gate against a real session log and reading every flag by hand:

  1. Leading dot stripped. `tok.strip(STRIP_CHARS)` strips from both ends,
     and STRIP_CHARS contains ".". A bare citation to a dotfile directory
     such as `.github/workflows/gate.yml` had its leading dot removed before
     resolution was even attempted, so a real path was flagged as missing.
     A leading dot is load-bearing (dotfiles, dotdirs); a trailing dot is
     almost always sentence punctuation. The fix strips those two ends with
     different character sets instead of one shared one.

  2. Version-numbered branch names read as file paths. The extension test
     was "does the basename contain a dot", which a version number also
     satisfies: `fix/v0.4.3-marketplace-rename` has a dot-bearing basename
     with no file extension anywhere in it. The fix adds a second, narrower
     positive test (does the text after the final dot look like a short
     alphanumeric extension) and a shape-based negative test for a
     version-number basename, so a real extension still qualifies while a
     branch name that merely contains dots does not.

  3. Possessives not stripped. STRIP_CHARS strips a trailing apostrophe, but
     the plain "s" that follows a possessive is not punctuation, so it
     blocked the strip and `scripts/check-dashes.py's` never resolved. The
     fix strips a trailing `'s` (ASCII or the typographic right single
     quote) as its own step before the general punctuation strip runs.

WHY THE MATCHER NEEDED REPAIR AGAIN THE SAME DAY (defects A through F,
2026-08-28, second pass)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The BUG-2 fixes above were themselves reviewed against a real session log
and found to have introduced one regression and left several rules with no
canary coverage at all, meaning any of them could be silently deleted or
weakened while the self-test still printed PASS.

  A. Regression. BUG-2 fix 2's extension test rejected anything after the
     final dot that was not a short alphanumeric run, which also rejects a
     line-number anchor: `path/file.md:42` has "md:42" after the final dot,
     not "md", so it silently left the D-12 rule's scope and a genuinely
     missing citation of that exact shape stopped being flagged. The fix is
     `strip_line_anchor()`: a trailing `:N` or `:N-M` is removed from the
     citation before the path-claim decision and before resolution, so
     `file.md:42` and `file.md:42-50` both reduce to `file.md`. A line
     anchor requires a digit immediately after the colon; a Windows drive
     letter's colon is always followed by `\\` or `/`, so the two shapes
     cannot be confused by this rule.

  B. The extension test from BUG-2 fix 2 had no canary that would fail if
     the test were deleted or neutered: every existing MUST_NOT_MATCH
     canary that exercised it had a fallback reason to be excluded (no
     separator, a real extension) even with the test gone. New MUST_NOT_MATCH
     canaries below use a genuinely missing path whose trailing dot-segment
     is extension-shaped only if the test is doing its job (too long, or
     containing a character the test rejects), so removing the test flips
     them from correctly-ignored to incorrectly-flagged.

  C. The typographic right single quote half of the possessive fix, and the
     ordering that lets a possessive still be found under trailing sentence
     punctuation (`SKILL.md's,`), had no canary in either direction.

  D. The version-number exclusion only recognised a hyphenated qualifier
     made of letters and digits (`-rc1`, `-codeql-v4`). A release-candidate
     qualifier that instead uses a dot (`v0.5.1-rc.2`) or is glued on
     without a hyphen (`v0.5.1rc1`) fell through to the extension test,
     which read the digit after the final dot as a one-character extension
     and produced exactly the false positive BUG-2 fix 2 was meant to kill.
     The version-shape regex now accepts both qualifier forms.

  E. A leading elision of three or more dots (`...skills/plab-guide/SKILL.md`,
     a reader's convention for "some path above here") was not being
     stripped, so the literal three-dot directory it named was checked for
     existence and never found. `./` and `../` are real relative-path
     prefixes and must never be touched; only a run of three or more
     leading dots is elision. `strip_ellipsis_prefix()` implements exactly
     that boundary and only that boundary.

  F. A non-UTF-8 byte, or a byte sequence a UTF-8 decoder rejects, in the
     log crashed with an uncaught UnicodeDecodeError, which Python turns
     into exit code 1, indistinguishable from FINDINGS. The general rule
     applies: unanticipated exceptions must exit 2, never 1. The log is
     now opened with the utf-8-sig codec (so a UTF-8 byte-order mark scans
     cleanly instead of attaching itself to the first token) and both the
     open and the read are wrapped to catch UnicodeDecodeError alongside
     OSError; the top-level `__main__` guard is the backstop for anything
     still unanticipated.

Each fix, old and new, is mechanical and each has a paired canary and
anti-canary below: one proving the false positive is gone or never existed,
one proving the citation shape is still evaluated and would be flagged if it
were genuinely missing. An anti-canary alone can be satisfied by silently
excluding a whole citation shape from checking, which is a blind spot, not a
fix, which is why every rule in this file has both.

CITATION SHAPES: WHAT IS IN SCOPE AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY OUT
----------------------------------------------------------------
In scope, and therefore flagged when the named file does not exist: a
citation carrying a path separator, or ending in `/` or `\\`, once normalized
(sentence punctuation trimmed, a trailing possessive removed, a trailing
line anchor removed, a leading three-or-more-dot elision removed), whose
basename either ends in `/` or `\\` (a directory claim) or has a final
dot-segment that looks like a real file extension: one to ten alphanumeric
characters, no hyphens, no embedded dots.

Out of scope, and therefore never flagged even when nothing resolves: a URI
with a scheme (`https://...`), a Windows absolute path (`C:\\...`), a glob
(`docs/skills/*/README.md`), a template placeholder (`_inbox/<skill>.md`), a
one-segment slash command (`/plab-wrap-session`), a basename shaped like a
version number with an optional hyphenated-and-or-dotted or glued-on
qualifier (`v0.4.3`, `v0.4.2-codeql-v4`, `v0.5.1-rc.2`, `v0.5.1rc1`), a
basename whose final dot-segment does not look like a real extension (too
long, contains a hyphen, or otherwise fails the extension shape test), and
any token that never carried a path separator to begin with (backtick-
wrapped or not: prose that merely names a bare filename never enters branch
(a); a bare filename with a separator prefix does).

--repo-root IS THE PROJECT BEING WRAPPED
----------------------------------------
Not this skill's installed location. Same contract as `organize-logs.py`'s
store argument (SKILL.md:91): "the store argument is relative to the project
being wrapped. Do not assume the two share a root."

The self-test never touches --repo-root. It builds a throwaway fixture and
resolves every canary against that instead, so the gate's trustworthiness does
not depend on which project happens to be under the cursor.
