plab-resolve-open-items self-check. Invoked by the skill after each write-back
and after writing each walk record, and by CI against the committed sample.

USAGE
-----
  walk-check.py record <walk-record.md>
  walk-check.py writeback <before.md> <after.md>

EXIT-CODE CONTRACT
------------------
  0  CLEAN    self-test passed AND the input satisfies every rule of its mode
  1  FINDINGS self-test passed AND at least one rule is violated
  2  BROKEN   a file is absent, unreadable or not UTF-8, a write-back pair has
              no decisions section in the documented format, the arguments
              are wrong, or the self-test could not prove this checker works

NEVER INTERPRET 2 AS CLEAN. "I could not look" is not "I looked and it was
fine". This is the same contract as `skills/plab-audit/scripts/bundle-check.py`
and the repository's own gates.

RECORD MODE: WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHICH ACCEPTANCE CRITERION EACH RULE CARRIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The format is `references/walk-record.md`. The criteria are WD-01's.

  R1  frontmatter: type walk-record, a YYYY-MM-DD date, a repo,     AC-10
      and an integer rounds of at least 1
  R2  an items table with exactly the seven documented columns,     AC-10
      and at least one row
  R3  every Walk ID is Q, D or T plus a number, and is unique       AC-2
  R4  every Home is "none" or ends in the item's own id             AC-3
  R5  every State belongs to its series' vocabulary                 AC-4, AC-6
  R6  every decided or provisional row names its Follow-up          AC-19
  R7  T rows land in the walk record only; unanswered D rows are    AC-20, AC-6
      "not written"; assumed Q rows answer "default: ..."
  R8  one "## Round N" section per round; no Round cell beyond      AC-18
      them; every provisional row quotes the maintainer's words

WRITEBACK MODE: WHAT IT CHECKS
------------------------------
It compares one document before and after a walk wrote to it. The format is
`references/decisions-section.md` at the plugin root: a summary table, one
"### <ID>: <Title> (<Status>)" subsection per item, and a maintainer block
after a "---" rule. A walk may change three surfaces and nothing else (AC-8).

  W1  everything outside the "## Open Questions / Decisions"        AC-8
      section is identical, and so is the section's own text
      outside its table and its items
  W2  each item's body, from its header to the rule before its       AC-8
      maintainer block, is identical; only the header's trailing
      status may change. No item is added, removed or renamed
  W3  in the summary table only Resolution, Status and Updated       AC-8
      may change; no row is added, removed or reordered
  W4  for every changed item, the table status, the header status    AC-8
      and the block's Status line agree
  W5  every changed block whose status is Decided or Provisional     AC-19
      carries a Follow-up line, except a pointer block, whose
      Choice begins "Recorded in" (the follow-up lives in the home)

Line endings are normalized before comparing, because a Windows checkout
rewrites them and that is not a change a walk made.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
-------------------------------------
Whether an answer was parsed correctly, whether a Follow-up names the right
action, whether an item's home was chosen well, and whether the walk gathered
the right items. Those are judgments the skill makes and a live walk proves.
A green result here means the record is complete and the write-back stayed in
bounds, not that the walk was right.
