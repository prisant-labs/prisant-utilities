# History - plab-guide

| Version | Date | Release | Type | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.2.2 | 2026-08-23 | unreleased | fix | Three internal contradictions with the v2.0.0 one-or-two-page contract, plus vestigial em-dash-sweep wording. |
| 2.2.1 | 2026-08-14 | v0.1.0 | migrated | First release in prisant-utilities. Migrated from a private upstream at version 2.2.1; prior history remains there. |

## 2.2.2 - 2026-08-23

Correctness only. No behavior added, and nothing about how a guide is authored changes.

v2.0.0 made a dense single page legal and gave `render-pdf.sh` an auto-fit step, but three places in
the skill were never updated to match, so the skill contradicted itself:

- `scripts/regression-test.sh` asserted `pages -eq 2` and would have failed a legitimate 1-page
  baseline, against the contract its own renderer documents in its header. It now accepts 1 or 2 and
  reports the actual count. The comparison is also guarded with `${pages:-0}`, so a missing `pdfinfo`
  reading falls through to the failure branch instead of erroring under `set -u`.
- `references/quick-ref-html-patterns.md` repeated "exactly 2 pages" in its G-8 row, and its
  anti-pattern table listed a 1-page result as a "page-count floor failure". The ink floor is the
  real gate; page count alone is not.
- `SKILL.md`'s failure table still said "Em-dash leaks past sweep". There is no sweep: G-11 is a
  written-discipline rule verified by grep, which the same table's own gate list already said.

Found while reconciling the public docs READMEs against shipped skill versions. The docs half of that
work is separate and touches no skill. The version line drift was the visible symptom; these were the
defect underneath it.

## 2.2.1 - 2026-08-14

First public release. The skill is unchanged in behaviour from its last private version; this entry records the move, not a feature change.

**Migration provenance.** 2 recorded invocations via the Skill tool and 2 typed slash invocations in Claude Code on the origin machine, as of 2026-08-14. The low Claude Code count understates real use: this skill's output bundles were produced across several sessions and the count reflects only invocations captured in local transcripts on one machine.

**Not carried over, and why.** The prior HISTORY file is deliberately not reproduced. It contained absolute machine paths to a personal knowledge vault on the author's disk, which is precisely the class of content this plugin exists to avoid publishing. The version numbering continues unbroken; only the narrative was dropped.

**Also not carried over.** `CREATION_NOTES.md`, 137 lines of internal build narrative keyed to private planning folders, does not ship. It was development workshop material, not documentation.

**Changed for public release.** The default output root moved from a brand-named folder to `_output/plab-guide/`. A worked example inside `assets/templates/guide-template_standard.md` was genericised: it had named a private library as a community example and attributed a fictional plugin to a real, named person. Both are now neutral placeholders.

**Dependencies.** This skill loads `lib/render-mermaid.py` and `references/diagrams.md` from the plugin root. Toolchain requirements (headless Chrome, `pdfinfo`, `mmdc`) are reported by `scripts/check-toolchain.sh` and degrade gracefully when absent.
